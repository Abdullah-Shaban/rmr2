# Compatibility testing for rmr 2.0.2
Please contribute with additional reports. To claim compatibility you need to run `R CMD  check path-to-rmr` successfully.
If you build your own Hadoop, see [Which Hadoop for rmr](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki/Which-Hadoop-for-rmr).
If you are interested in the compatibility chart for other releases, choose one from the drop down menu on the top left, under tags. Not every release gets a complete round of testing, so typically a bug fix release (change in the third number only) is equally or more compatible than the previous release, even if we don't have the resource to test it directly.
